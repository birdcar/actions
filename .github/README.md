> @birdcar's helpful GitHub actions

Since the release of GitHub Actions, I've found myself writing a lot of the same actions over and over again. I've also found cool use cases in private repositories or at random in the open, but that need to be tweaked in this way or that to be useful to me personally.

With that experience in mind, I've created this repository to contain all the common GitHub Actions I rely on.

## Usage

Each directory in this repository -- with the exception of the `bin` directory -- is its own GitHub Action and contains its own README explaining how to use it and what inputs and outputs (if any) it requires.

## Contributing

Since these are actions designed for my own use, contributions are informal and may or may not be accepted depending on how helpful it is to my use cases specifically.

You're welcome to use the actions or fork the repo and modify the actions to your heart's content. However, I can't promise that I'll merge Pull Requests or fix issues that don't affect my use personally.
